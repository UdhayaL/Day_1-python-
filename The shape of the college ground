The shape of the college ground is Square. For the Independence day Flag Hoisting Function, it has been decided to place the flag post at the exact center of the ground. Can you please help them in placing the flag post at the exact center? Given the coordinates of the left bottom vertex of the square ground and the length of the side, you need to write a program to determine the coordinates of the centre of the ground. [Assumption --- Length of the side is always even]

Input Format

Input consists of 3 integers. The first integer corresponds to the x-coordinate of the left bottom vertex. The second integer corresponds to the y-coordinate of the left bottom vertex. The third integer corresponds to the length of the square.
